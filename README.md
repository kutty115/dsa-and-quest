* **Divide and Conquer** – Advanced problems like Reverse Pairs
* **Hash** – Hashing-based problems (e.g., First Missing Positive)
* **Heap** – Heap-based problem solving
* **Linked List** – Linked list operations (e.g., reverse linked list)
* **Monotonic Stack** – Stack problems using monotonic properties
* **Prefix Sums** – Prefix sum based logic and applications
* **Queue** – Queue implementation problems (e.g., queue using stacks)
* **Sorting** – Interval merging and sorting techniques
* **Stack** – Stack-based problems like exclusive time of functions
* **String** – String manipulation problems (e.g., masking personal info)
* **String_matching** – String matching algorithms
* **Types of Sorting** – Fundamental sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort)
